Telemetry data helps you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior. This data must be generated, collected and exported. For this, three types of data channels are used: logs, metrics and traces.

Sometimes we need to send same data to both logs and traces, and we need to take into account the characteristics of each channel. For example:

1. We should add our service version and its environment information to each trace span and each log entry. This is necessary to identify the telemetry source, i.e. to identify which service sent this data and where it is located.
2. We should add query resource identification attributes to each log entry for every REST API query. The same data must be added in trace span tags. This is necessary to find all the telemetry data quickly associated with the specific resource while supporting your software.
3. We should add RabbitMQ message identification attributes to each log entry while processing it. The same data must be added in trace span tags. This is necessary to find all the telemetry data quickly associated with the specific resource while supporting your software.

You can use the packages provided in this repository to simplify the process of collecting and sending data to logs and traces.

# Byndyusoft.Telemetry [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry/)

This package provides *TelemetryItem* type that is used for logging and tracing purposes. It has only two properties:
 - *Name* represents activity tag key or log object property name.
 - *Value* represents the value of telemetry item.

This package also provides static and object telemetry item collector.

## Installing

```shell
dotnet add package Byndyusoft.Telemetry
```

## Usage

### Static telemetry item collector

To use static telemetry item collector you have to register it with all data providers that implement *IStaticTelemetryItemProvider* interface.

There are four standard providers that are presented in example below.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddStaticTelemetryItemCollector()
    .WithBuildConfiguration()
    .WithAspNetCoreEnvironment()
    .WithServiceName(serviceName)
    .WithApplicationVersion("0.0.0.1");
```


Build configuration provider collects environment variables with names that have **BUILD_** prefix.
ASP NET Core environment configuration provides **ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT** environment value.
Service name and application version providers provide service name and application version respectively =)

These data are available by using *StaticTelemetryItemsCollector* class.

### Object telemetry item collector

*ObjectTelemetryItemsCollector* class is used for extracting parameter telemetry items:
- Currently if parameter is not object (for example, integer or string value) and its name ends with **id** value then it returns the parameter itself.
- If parameter is object then all its public properties marked with *TelemetryItemAttribute* will be extracted.

This class should be used by different instrumentation tools such as:
- Http action filters.
- RabbitMq consumers.
- Kafka consumers.

# Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Abstraction [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Abstraction.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Abstraction/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Abstraction.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Abstraction/)

This class provides *TelemetryItemAttribute* attribute that is used by *ObjectTelemetryItemsCollector* described above.

## Installing

```shell
dotnet add package Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Abstraction
```

## Usage

Mark all public properties with *TelemetryItemAttribute* so they will be extracted by *ObjectTelemetryItemsCollector*.

```csharp
public class TestObject
{
	[TelemetryItem]
	public int ToLogInt { get; set; }

	[TelemetryItem]
	public string? ToLogString { get; set; }

	public int NotToLog { get; set; }
}
```

In this example only **ToLogInt** and **ToLogString** properties will be extracted. **NotToLog** will not be extracted.

# Byndyusoft.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry/)

This package is used for integration with OpenTelemetry.

## Installing

```shell
dotnet add package Byndyusoft.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry
```

## Usage

### Static telemetry items in resource

Static telemetry items can be added to OpenTelemetry resource information by *AddStaticTelemetryItems* extension method.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry().WithTracing(tracerProviderBuilder =>
{
    tracerProviderBuilder
        .SetResourceBuilder(ResourceBuilder
            .CreateDefault()
            .AddService(serviceName)
            .AddStaticTelemetryItems())
        .AddConsoleExporter();
});
```

Static data are collected by *StaticTelemetryItemsCollector* class which is described above. All static data providers must be registered before OpenTelemetry.

### Activity enrichment with tags

You can use *ActivityTagEnricher* to enrich activity with tags from telemetry items. Here is an example:

```csharp
var telemetryItem = new TelemetryItem("method.type", "test");
ActivityTagEnricher.Enrich(telemetryItem);
```

# Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging/)

This package is used for integration with logging.

## Installing

```shell
dotnet add package Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging
```

## Usage

*LogPropertyDataAccessor* is used for collecting telemetry items that are available in async context.
Here is an example for sending telemetry items to *LogPropertyDataAccessor* in controller action method:

```csharp
LogPropertyDataAccessor.AddTelemetryItem("method.type", "test");
```

# Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.Serilog [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.Serilog.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.Serilog/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.Serilog.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.Serilog/)

This package is used for integration with Serilog.

## Installing

```shell
dotnet add package Byndyusoft.Telemetry.Logging.Serilog
```

## Usage

To enrich all logs with static telemetry items collected by *StaticTelemetryItemsCollector* (described above) use *WithPropertyDataAccessor* extension method.
To enrich all logs with telemetry items collected by *LogPropertyDataAccessor* (described above) use *WithPropertyDataAccessor* extension method.

```csharp
builder.Host.UseSerilog((_, loggerConfiguration) =>
{
    loggerConfiguration
        .Enrich.WithPropertyDataAccessor()
        .Enrich.WithStaticTelemetryItems();
    loggerConfiguration.WriteTo.Console(new JsonFormatter());
});
```
